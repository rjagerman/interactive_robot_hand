ROS Assignment 1
===============
This is the documentation for the software solution of the first assignment for the minor robotics.
This software uses ROS as its framework and is dependent on several packages (ROS-Hydro, roscpp, std_msgs, threemxl, phidgets and more).

The basic solution constitutes three nodes:

1. Hand - Representing the gripper
2. Brain - Makes the decisions
3. Eyes - Representing the sensor
